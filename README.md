# Scrapsters API
This is the API that powers the Scrapsters app! More info on [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/scrapsters).

# Setup and run

Get a valid OpenAi key.

Create a `.env` file on the root of the repo with the following content:

```
OPENAI_KEY=<valid-key-of-openai>
```

Then, you can install the requirements and run the web app:
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
flask run
```

Enjoy!
